# About

This application will run inside 3 containers and 2 networks.

`database` and `query service` are running on the same network (`db_network`) which is private.

`query service` and `api service` are on the same network (`api_network`)

Only `api service` is publicly accessible which will run on port `8080`

## Gotchas

The initial startup might take some time. since the db is very large (`23 MB` dump file). The init script runs only one time during the container creation. Subsequent runs will be faster
